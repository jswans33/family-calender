# All-Day Event Issue Documentation

## Problem Summary

All-day events created by users are being converted to timed events at 6 AM after CalDAV sync, losing their all-day status.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Users Enter:

- Date: "2025-08-29"
- Time: "" (empty string, indicating all-day)
- Duration: "PT24H0M" (24 hours)
- Creation Source: "user"

### What Gets Stored in Database After CalDAV Sync:

- Date: "2025-08-29T06:00:00.000Z"
- Time: "00:00" (midnight local time)
- Duration: "PT24H0M" (still 24 hours)
- Start: "2025-08-29T06:00:00.000Z" (6 AM UTC)
- End: "2025-08-29T07:00:00.000Z" (7 AM UTC, only 1 hour!)
- Timezone: "America/Denver"

### The Issue:

1. **Timezone Conversion Problem**: Midnight in Denver (MT) = 6 AM UTC
2. **iCalendar Format Problem**: All-day events should use DATE format, not DATETIME
3. **CalDAV Interpretation**: Apple CalDAV is treating "00:00" as a timed event, not all-day

## Technical Details

### Current All-Day Detection Logic (should work but doesn't):

```typescript
const isAllDay =
  !event.time ||
  event.time === '' ||
  event.time === 'All Day' ||
  event.time === 'all day' ||
  event.time === '12:00 AM' ||
  event.time === '00:00' ||
  event.time === '0:00' ||
  event.duration === 'PT24H0M';
```

### Expected iCalendar Format for All-Day Events:

```
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20250829
DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20250830
```

### Current iCalendar Format (incorrect for all-day):

```
DTSTART:20250829T000000Z  // This becomes 20250829T060000Z in UTC
DTEND:20250829T010000Z    // End time gets calculated wrong
```

## Data Preservation Fields Added:

- `original_date`: User's exact input
- `original_time`: User's exact input (empty for all-day)
- `original_duration`: User's exact choice
- `creation_source`: 'user' | 'caldav' | 'sync'
- `caldav_processed_at`: When CalDAV last processed

## Debugging Logs Added:

- üì® CREATE EVENT REQUEST - Raw form data
- üîç VALIDATION DEBUG - All field values including originals
- üìÖ iCAL GENERATION DEBUG - How event gets converted to iCalendar
- CalDAV sync comparison - Before/after values

## Files Modified:

1. `/src/types/shared.ts` - Added original data fields
2. `/src/components/primitives/EventModal.tsx` - Store original user input
3. `/src/components/primitives/TimeGrid.tsx` - All-day detection logic
4. `/server-src/controllers/CalendarController.ts` - Preserve original data
5. `/server-src/services/ValidationService.ts` - Debug logging
6. `/server-src/utils/iCalendarGenerator.ts` - All-day event handling

## Next Steps to Fix:

1. ‚úÖ Document the issue (this file)
2. ‚úÖ Add comprehensive logging to track iCalendar generation
3. ‚úÖ Add database preservation of original values
4. ‚úÖ Research RFC 5545 and working implementations
5. ‚úÖ Set up Jest testing framework with ES modules
6. üîÑ Write comprehensive unit tests for iCalendarGenerator (6/10 passing)
7. üîÑ Fix missing generateVEvent method in iCalendarGenerator
8. üîÑ Make all unit tests pass for RFC 5545 compliance
9. üîÑ Fix iCalendar generation to use proper DATE format for all-day events
10. üîÑ Ensure no timezone conversion for all-day events
11. üîÑ Test that CalDAV properly recognizes DATE format as all-day

## Unit Test Results (Current Status):

‚úÖ **6/10 tests passing:**

- All-day detection logic works correctly
- Date formatting works correctly for both all-day and timed events
- Empty time detection ‚úÖ
- PT24H0M duration detection ‚úÖ
- "All Day" string detection ‚úÖ
- Regular time NOT detected as all-day ‚úÖ
- Date-only format (20250829) ‚úÖ
- DateTime format with timezone ‚úÖ

‚ùå **4/10 tests failing:**

- Missing `generateVEvent` method - core issue
- Cannot test full iCalendar output generation
- Cannot validate DTSTART;VALUE=DATE format
- Cannot test end date calculation

## RFC 5545 Specification Requirements:

- All-day events MUST use `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20250829`
- DTEND MUST also use `VALUE=DATE` if present
- End date is **exclusive** (next day): `DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20250830`
- NO timezone conversion for DATE values
- Example from working libraries:
  ```
  BEGIN:VEVENT
  DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20250829
  DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20250830
  SUMMARY:All Day Event
  END:VEVENT
  ```

## Test Cases Needed:

- [ ] Create all-day event via modal
- [ ] Verify original values are preserved
- [ ] Check iCalendar output uses DATE format
- [ ] Confirm no timezone conversion occurs
- [ ] Verify CalDAV sync maintains all-day status
- [ ] Test editing all-day events
- [ ] Test multi-day all-day events

## Known Issues:

- Original data fields not being saved to database (all showing null)
- iCalendar generator not using DATE format for all-day events
- Timezone conversion happening when it shouldn't for all-day events
- End time calculation wrong for all-day events (1 hour instead of next day)
