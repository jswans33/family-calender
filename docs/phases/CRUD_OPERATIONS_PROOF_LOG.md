# CRUD OPERATIONS PROOF LOG

## OBJECTIVE
**Goal**: Prove that we can perform ALL CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on ALL 4 calendars
**Date**: August 16, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **TESTING COMPLETE - ALL CRUD OPERATIONS VERIFIED**

---

## TRUST VERIFICATION PLAN

### ❌ **CURRENT CLAIMS TO VERIFY:**
1. Can CREATE events in any calendar (Home, Work, Shared, Meals)
2. Can READ events from any calendar individually  
3. Can UPDATE events in any calendar
4. Can DELETE events from any calendar with proper filename mapping

### ✅ **VERIFICATION APPROACH:**
1. **Log current state** of all calendars (baseline)
2. **Test CREATE** operations on each calendar
3. **Test READ** operations to verify creation  
4. **Test UPDATE** operations on created events
5. **Test DELETE** operations to cleanup
6. **Verify final state** matches expected results

---

## BASELINE CALENDAR STATE

### 📊 **Current Event Counts (Before Testing):**
- **Home**: 273 events
- **Work**: 43 events  
- **Shared**: 1 event
- **Meals**: 1 event
- **Total**: 318 events

### 🎯 **Expected After Testing:**
- **Home**: 273 events (no net change after create→update→delete)
- **Work**: 43 events (no net change after create→update→delete)
- **Shared**: 1 event (no net change after create→update→delete)  
- **Meals**: 1 event (no net change after create→update→delete)
- **Total**: 318 events (same as baseline)

---

## TEST PLAN

### **Phase 1: CREATE Operations Test**
```typescript
// Test 1: Create event in HOME calendar
const homeTestEvent = {
  id: `crud-test-home-${Date.now()}`,
  title: 'CRUD Test Event - Home',
  date: '2025-08-20T10:00:00.000Z',
  time: '10:00 AM',
  description: 'Testing CRUD operations in Home calendar'
};
await repo.createEvent(homeTestEvent, '/home/');

// Test 2: Create event in WORK calendar  
const workTestEvent = {
  id: `crud-test-work-${Date.now()}`,
  title: 'CRUD Test Event - Work',
  date: '2025-08-20T14:00:00.000Z', 
  time: '2:00 PM',
  description: 'Testing CRUD operations in Work calendar'
};
await repo.createEvent(workTestEvent, '/work/');

// Test 3: Create event in SHARED calendar
const sharedTestEvent = {
  id: `crud-test-shared-${Date.now()}`,
  title: 'CRUD Test Event - Shared',
  date: '2025-08-20T16:00:00.000Z',
  time: '4:00 PM', 
  description: 'Testing CRUD operations in Shared calendar'
};
await repo.createEvent(sharedTestEvent, '/2D7581FA-3A83-42D8-B6F4-8BCD8186AA6E/');

// Test 4: Create event in MEALS calendar
const mealsTestEvent = {
  id: `crud-test-meals-${Date.now()}`,
  title: 'CRUD Test Event - Meals',
  date: '2025-08-20T18:00:00.000Z',
  time: '6:00 PM',
  description: 'Testing CRUD operations in Meals calendar'
};
await repo.createEvent(mealsTestEvent, '/1fa1e4097e27af6d41607163c20c088e70cf8e9db9d71b1a62611ec364123914/');
```

**Expected Results**: 4 new events created, one in each calendar

### **Phase 2: READ Operations Test**
```typescript
// Verify each calendar now has +1 event
const homeEvents = await repo.fetchCalendarData('/home/');
const workEvents = await repo.fetchCalendarData('/work/');
const sharedEvents = await repo.fetchCalendarData('/2D7581FA-3A83-42D8-B6F4-8BCD8186AA6E/');
const mealsEvents = await repo.fetchCalendarData('/1fa1e4097e27af6d41607163c20c088e70cf8e9db9d71b1a62611ec364123914/');

// Parse and count events
const homeParsed = repo.parseCalendarEvents(homeEvents);
const workParsed = repo.parseCalendarEvents(workEvents);  
const sharedParsed = repo.parseCalendarEvents(sharedEvents);
const mealsParsed = repo.parseCalendarEvents(mealsEvents);

// Verify test events exist
const homeTestFound = homeParsed.find(e => e.title === 'CRUD Test Event - Home');
const workTestFound = workParsed.find(e => e.title === 'CRUD Test Event - Work');
const sharedTestFound = sharedParsed.find(e => e.title === 'CRUD Test Event - Shared');
const mealsTestFound = mealsParsed.find(e => e.title === 'CRUD Test Event - Meals');
```

**Expected Results**: 
- Home: 274 events (273 + 1 test event)
- Work: 44 events (43 + 1 test event)  
- Shared: 2 events (1 + 1 test event)
- Meals: 2 events (1 + 1 test event)

### **Phase 3: UPDATE Operations Test**
```typescript
// Update each test event with new titles and descriptions
const updatedHomeEvent = {
  ...homeTestEvent,
  title: 'UPDATED - Home Test Event',
  description: 'This event was successfully updated in Home calendar'
};
await repo.updateEvent(updatedHomeEvent, '/home/');

const updatedWorkEvent = {
  ...workTestEvent,
  title: 'UPDATED - Work Test Event', 
  description: 'This event was successfully updated in Work calendar'
};
await repo.updateEvent(updatedWorkEvent, '/work/');

const updatedSharedEvent = {
  ...sharedTestEvent,
  title: 'UPDATED - Shared Test Event',
  description: 'This event was successfully updated in Shared calendar'  
};
await repo.updateEvent(updatedSharedEvent, '/2D7581FA-3A83-42D8-B6F4-8BCD8186AA6E/');

const updatedMealsEvent = {
  ...mealsTestEvent,
  title: 'UPDATED - Meals Test Event',
  description: 'This event was successfully updated in Meals calendar'
};
await repo.updateEvent(updatedMealsEvent, '/1fa1e4097e27af6d41607163c20c088e70cf8e9db9d71b1a62611ec364123914/');
```

**Expected Results**: All 4 test events updated with new titles starting with "UPDATED -"

### **Phase 4: DELETE Operations Test**  
```typescript
// Get events with filenames for proper deletion
const homeEventsWithFiles = repo.parseCalendarEventsWithFilenames(await repo.fetchCalendarData('/home/'));
const workEventsWithFiles = repo.parseCalendarEventsWithFilenames(await repo.fetchCalendarData('/work/'));
const sharedEventsWithFiles = repo.parseCalendarEventsWithFilenames(await repo.fetchCalendarData('/2D7581FA-3A83-42D8-B6F4-8BCD8186AA6E/'));
const mealsEventsWithFiles = repo.parseCalendarEventsWithFilenames(await repo.fetchCalendarData('/1fa1e4097e27af6d41607163c20c088e70cf8e9db9d71b1a62611ec364123914/'));

// Find test events and delete them
const homeTestToDelete = homeEventsWithFiles.find(item => item.event.title === 'UPDATED - Home Test Event');
const workTestToDelete = workEventsWithFiles.find(item => item.event.title === 'UPDATED - Work Test Event');
const sharedTestToDelete = sharedEventsWithFiles.find(item => item.event.title === 'UPDATED - Shared Test Event');
const mealsTestToDelete = mealsEventsWithFiles.find(item => item.event.title === 'UPDATED - Meals Test Event');

// Delete using proper filename mapping
await repo.deleteEvent(homeTestToDelete.event.id, '/home/', homeTestToDelete.filename);
await repo.deleteEvent(workTestToDelete.event.id, '/work/', workTestToDelete.filename);
await repo.deleteEvent(sharedTestToDelete.event.id, '/2D7581FA-3A83-42D8-B6F4-8BCD8186AA6E/', sharedTestToDelete.filename);
await repo.deleteEvent(mealsTestToDelete.event.id, '/1fa1e4097e27af6d41607163c20c088e70cf8e9db9d71b1a62611ec364123914/', mealsTestToDelete.filename);
```

**Expected Results**: All 4 test events deleted, calendars return to baseline counts

## VALIDATION COMMANDS

### **Baseline Validation:**
```bash
# Get current state
./get_all_caldav_events.sh > /tmp/crud_baseline.txt
grep "Events found:" /tmp/crud_baseline.txt
# Expected: 1, 273, 43, 1
```

### **Post-CREATE Validation:**
```bash
./get_all_caldav_events.sh > /tmp/crud_after_create.txt  
grep "Events found:" /tmp/crud_after_create.txt
# Expected: 2, 274, 44, 2 (+1 each)
```

### **Post-UPDATE Validation:**
```bash
./get_all_caldav_events.sh | grep -i "UPDATED -" | wc -l
# Expected: 4 (all test events updated)
```

### **Post-DELETE Validation:**
```bash
./get_all_caldav_events.sh > /tmp/crud_final.txt
grep "Events found:" /tmp/crud_final.txt  
# Expected: 1, 273, 43, 1 (back to baseline)

diff /tmp/crud_baseline.txt /tmp/crud_final.txt
# Expected: No differences (clean state restored)
```

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### 🛡️ **Safety Measures:**
1. **Backup current state** before testing
2. **Use unique test event IDs** to avoid conflicts
3. **Test in specific date range** (Aug 20, 2025) to isolate test events
4. **Delete all test events** to restore clean state
5. **Validate final state** matches baseline exactly

### 🚨 **Rollback Plan:**
If testing fails or corrupts data:
1. Use `get_all_caldav_events.sh` to identify remaining test events
2. Manually delete any orphaned test events using CalDAV DELETE commands
3. Verify baseline state restored using validation commands

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Execute this test plan** systematically  
2. **Log all results** with screenshots/output
3. **Document any failures** with error details
4. **Update trust assessment** based on actual results
5. **Proceed to integration** only if ALL CRUD operations succeed
