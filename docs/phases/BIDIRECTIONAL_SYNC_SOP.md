# Complete Bidirectional Sync System - Production Ready

**Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

**Last Updated:** August 16, 2025  
**Test Results:** All deletion sync scenarios working perfectly  
**Production Status:** Ready for family use

## Overview

The Swanson Light calendar system maintains perfect synchronization between three components:

- **React Web App** (http://localhost:3000) - User interface
- **SQLite Database** (./data/calendar.db) - Local cache and source of truth
- **Apple CalDAV Server** (iCloud SHARED calendar) - Cloud storage for family access

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  React App  │ <-> │   SQLite     │ <-> │  Apple CalDAV   │
│   (UI)      │     │  Database    │     │ SHARED Calendar │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
      ↓                    ↓                      ↓
   User Actions      Local Storage          Family Devices
                   (with deletion tracking)
```

## 🎯 Current Status - Complete Bidirectional Sync System Working!

✅ **LOCAL → CALDAV SYNC (React → iPhone)**

- Create event via React → SQLite with `sync_status='pending'` → CalDAV → iPhone
- Update event via React → SQLite with `sync_status='pending'` → CalDAV delete+create → iPhone
- Delete event via React → `deleted_events` table → CalDAV deletion → iPhone removal

✅ **CALDAV → LOCAL SYNC (iPhone → React)**

- Force sync pulls all CalDAV events
- Detects events missing from CalDAV (iPhone deletions)
- Moves missing events to `deleted_events` table
- Updates React app immediately
- Preserves local metadata for active events

✅ **SMART DELETION FILTERING**

- Prevents deleted events from being restored during sync
- Maintains clean separation between active and deleted events
- Provides complete deletion audit trail
- Supports both local and remote deletion sources

✅ **REAL-WORLD TESTED**

- Successfully processed 277 iPhone deletions in single sync
- Maintains sync stability across multiple operations
- No deleted events reappear after sync operations
- Complete family calendar synchronization working

## Complete Bidirectional Deletion Sync System

### Problems We Solved

#### Problem 1: React → iPhone Deletion Sync

When an event was deleted in the React app and "Sync with Apple Calendar" was clicked, the deleted event would reappear because sync would fetch it from CalDAV and restore it.

#### Problem 2: iPhone → React Deletion Sync

When an event was deleted on iPhone, it would remain visible in the React app until manually synced, and the app had no way to detect iPhone deletions.

### Complete Solution Implemented

#### 1. Local Deletion Tracking (React → iPhone)

When an event is deleted via React app:

- Remove from `events` table
- Add to `deleted_events` table with `synced_to_caldav=0`
- Mark for CalDAV deletion during next sync

#### 2. Remote Deletion Detection (iPhone → React)

During sync from CalDAV:

- Compare CalDAV events with local `events` table
- Detect events missing from CalDAV (iPhone deletions)
- Move missing events to `deleted_events` table with `synced_to_caldav=1`
- Remove from React app immediately

#### 3. Smart Sync Filtering

During CalDAV → Local sync:

- Filter out events that exist in `deleted_events` table
- Prevent locally deleted events from being restored
- Maintain deletion state across syncs

#### 4. Bidirectional Deletion Propagation

During sync process:

- Sync pending local deletions to CalDAV (`synced_to_caldav=0` → `synced_to_caldav=1`)
- Detect and track remote deletions from CalDAV
- Maintain complete audit trail of all deletions

## Database Schema - Complete Deletion Tracking

### Events Table (Active Events)

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  time TEXT NOT NULL,
  -- ... metadata fields ...
  sync_status TEXT,        -- 'pending' or 'synced'
  local_modified TEXT,     -- Timestamp of local modification
  synced_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Deleted Events Table (Deletion Audit Trail)

```sql
CREATE TABLE deleted_events (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                    -- Original event ID
  deleted_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,  -- When deletion occurred
  synced_to_caldav BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0     -- 0=local deletion, 1=remote deletion
)
```

### Deletion Types

- **`synced_to_caldav=0`**: Deleted in React app, needs CalDAV sync
- **`synced_to_caldav=1`**: Deleted on iPhone, already synced from CalDAV

## 🔄 Complete Sync Flow Details

### Creating Events (React → CalDAV → iPhone)

```
POST /events → SQLite (sync_status='pending') → Background Sync → CalDAV SHARED → Family iPhones
```

### Updating Events (React → CalDAV → iPhone)

```
PUT /events/:id → SQLite (sync_status='pending') → Delete from CalDAV → Create in CalDAV → Family iPhones
```

### Deleting Events (React → CalDAV → iPhone)

```
DELETE /events/:id → SQLite deletion + deleted_events tracking → CalDAV DELETE → iPhone removal
```

### iPhone Deletions (iPhone → CalDAV → React)

```
iPhone deletion → Missing from CalDAV → Sync detects absence → deleted_events tracking → React removal
```

### Smart Sync Process (CalDAV → React)

```
1. Fetch all events from CalDAV
2. Compare with local events table
3. Detect missing events (iPhone deletions)
4. Move missing events to deleted_events table
5. Filter incoming events against deleted_events table
6. Save only non-deleted events to SQLite
7. Update React app with clean event list
```

### Sync Trigger Points

1. **Event Creation**: Immediate background sync to CalDAV
2. **Event Update**: Immediate background sync to CalDAV
3. **Event Deletion**: Immediate CalDAV deletion + tracking
4. **Manual Sync Button**: Full bidirectional sync with deletion detection
5. **App Startup**: Initial sync from CalDAV with cleanup

## Code Implementation

### SQLiteRepository.ts - Key Methods

```typescript
// Track LOCAL deletion (React app deletion)
async deleteEvent(eventId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Transaction: DELETE from events + INSERT into deleted_events with synced_to_caldav=0
}

// Track REMOTE deletion (iPhone deletion)
async trackRemoteDeletion(eventId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Transaction: DELETE from events + INSERT into deleted_events with synced_to_caldav=1
}

// Check if event was deleted from either source
async isEventDeleted(eventId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Query deleted_events table
}

// Smart sync with bidirectional deletion detection
async saveEventsWithSmartSync(events: CalendarEvent[]): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Detect events missing from CalDAV (iPhone deletions)
  // 2. Track remote deletions
  // 3. Filter out all deleted events before saving
  // 4. Save remaining events with metadata preservation
}

// Get all local event IDs for comparison
async getAllEventIds(): Promise<string[]> {
  // Return all current event IDs from events table
}

// Get deletions that need CalDAV sync
async getDeletedEventsToSync(): Promise<string[]> {
  // Return deleted events with synced_to_caldav=0
}
```

### DatabaseCalendarService.ts - Sync Logic

```typescript
async forceSync(): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Sync deletions to CalDAV first
  await this.syncDeletionsToCalDAV();

  // 2. Fetch from CalDAV
  const events = await this.calDAVRepository.fetchCalendarData();

  // 3. Smart sync (filters deleted events)
  await this.sqliteRepository.saveEventsWithSmartSync(events);

  // 4. Cleanup old records
  await this.sqliteRepository.cleanupDeletedEvents();
}
```

## Testing Verification - All Test Cases Passed ✅

6. ✅ Database: Event moved from `events` to `deleted_events` with `synced_to_caldav=1`
7. ✅ React app: Event disappears immediately after sync
8. ✅ Total events tracked: 277 iPhone deletions detected and processed

### Test Case 3: Sync Stability

1. ✅ Delete events from both React app and iPhone
2. ✅ Click "Sync with Apple Calendar" multiple times
3. ✅ No deleted events reappear
4. ✅ Sync logs show "Skipping event [ID] - was deleted locally"
5. ✅ Database maintains clean separation of active vs deleted events
6. ✅ Deletion audit trail preserved in `deleted_events` table

### Test Case 4: Massive Cleanup Verification

**Real Test Results:**

- ✅ **Before sync**: ~278 events in `events` table
- ✅ **After sync**: 1 event in `events` table, 277 events in `deleted_events` table
- ✅ **All iPhone deletions detected**: System found 277 events missing from CalDAV
- ✅ **Complete audit trail**: Every deletion tracked with timestamp and sync status
- ✅ **React app cleaned up**: Only current/active events visible

## Calendar Configuration - SHARED Calendar Required

**Why SHARED Calendar:**

- ✅ **Write Permissions**: Only SHARED calendars accept PUT/DELETE operations
- ✅ **Family Access**: All family members can view and edit events
- ✅ **Cross-Device Sync**: Changes appear on all family iPhones/iPads
- ✅ **Deletion Sync**: Deletions propagate to all devices

**Calendar Discovery Results:**

```bash
curl -X PROPFIND https://p36-caldav.icloud.com/1110188709/calendars/ \
  -H "Depth: 1" | grep displayname

## API Endpoints

### Event Management

- `GET /events` - Fetch all events from SQLite
- `POST /events` - Create new event (marks as pending sync)
- `PUT /events/:id` - Update event (marks as pending sync)
- `DELETE /events/:id` - Delete event (tracks deletion)

### Sync Operations

- `POST /admin/sync` - Force bidirectional sync

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Deletion Status

```bash
# Total deleted events
sqlite3 data/calendar.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deleted_events;"

# Local deletions pending CalDAV sync
sqlite3 data/calendar.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deleted_events WHERE synced_to_caldav=0;"

# Remote deletions (iPhone deletions)
sqlite3 data/calendar.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deleted_events WHERE synced_to_caldav=1;"

# Active events
sqlite3 data/calendar.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;"
```

### Watch Sync Activity

```bash
# Monitor server logs for sync operations
tail -f server.log | grep -E "sync|delete|missing|Skipping"

# Watch for deletion tracking
tail -f server.log | grep "tracked as.*deletion"
```

**Solution**: Implemented complete bidirectional deletion tracking system

### Issue: iPhone deletions not syncing to React

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETELY FIXED  
**Solution**: Added remote deletion detection during CalDAV sync

### Issue: CalDAV returns 500 error

**Cause**: Using wrong calendar (Home/Work instead of SHARED)
**Solution**: Use SHARED calendar ID `2D7581FA-3A83-42D8-B6F4-8BCD8186AA6E`

### Issue: Events not syncing to iPhone

**Cause**: Not using family SHARED calendar
**Solution**: Ensure using calendar ID `2D7581FA-3A83-42D8-B6F4-8BCD8186AA6E`
